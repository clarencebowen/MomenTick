# momentick
This repo contains sample code of a trading app I recently started building, namely **"MomenTick"**, inspired by own personal trading style of equities. 
"Momentick" comes from **"momentum"** + **"tick"**, a name I came up with to reflect a very important feature I look at while trading: *price momentum*. 
This project is currently in pre-alpha/scratchwork design phase. See the pre-alpha [product](http://www.opencurb.nyc/momentick) live.
